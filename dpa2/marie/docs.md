### Task 04:

1) iterate over the array and replace the entries:

    ```
   for i from 0 to n: 
        if A[i]: 
            A[i] = i, infinity otherwise
   ```
   $n$ operations using $\frac{n}{log(n)}$ processors for a runtime of $O(log(n))$
2) reduce the entire array using the min-operation to get the minimum index as a result with a 
total runtime of $O(log(n))$. If the result is $\infty$ no entry in the input array is true.
